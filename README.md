# CS665-TLBLEED
Course Project - Secure Memory System



DONE:
1. TLB Reverse Engineering (Finding the associativity, sets & sharing between hyperthread for l1dtlb, l1itlb, l2stlb).
2. Timing the L1TLB_HIT, L1_TLB_MISS.L2_STLB_HIT, L2_STLB_MISS.

TO-DO:
1. Clean and Update Reverse Engineering  code on repo.
2. Create frequency distribution graph of L1_TLB_HIT/L2_TLB_HIT/L2_TLB_MISS.
3. Create google(shareable) document & write experiment and their result conducted so far.
3. Create attack code.
